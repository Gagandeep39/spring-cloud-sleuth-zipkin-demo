# Zipkin 

- Distributed tracing System 
- Gathers timing data 
- Helps in troubleshooing latency problem
- Lookup and storage of Logs
- Zipkin client dependency has Spring cloud sleuth built in

## Important Spring Sleth Classes

- brave.servlet.TracingFilter
- brave.propagation.TraceContext
- brave.propagation.ThreadLocalCurrentTraceContext
- brave.Trace
- org.slf4j.MDC

## Steps to use Zipkin
### Part A
1. Download jar file from https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart
2. Run the Zipkin server using ```java -jar zipkin.jar```
3. Open the GUI in browser using http://localhost:9411 (Can be found in logs of zipkin jar execution)

### Part B
1. Add/Replace(if cloud sleuth dependency exist) with Zipkin Client Dependency \
** If the Zipkin Server is not running, the microservice will throw exception, to fix this use below code **
```
spring:
    zipkin:
        enabled: false
```
2. Run the Zipkin server 
3. Add the following in yaml file to specify perfentage of logs to export 
```
  sleuth:
    sampler:
      rate: 100
```

### Part C 
1. Generate Logs by running the application
2. Refresh the Zipkkin Server Page (To see the logs generated by microservuce in server)
3. Select a service -> Find Trace

# Spring Sleuth

- Library Used for Logging
- Modifies the dault Log Pattern to make it more informative 
- Helps us understand exactly which service or request has caused an error
- A form of Zipkin Library
- USes Trace and Span ID
1. Trace ID - Common for a request
2. Span ID - CHanges for change in microservice

Sample Log of Portal Servivce 
```
2020-05-02 17:45:49.360  INFO [doctor-portal,2bab3210f7517ebe,2bab3210f7517ebe,false] 15056 --- [nio-7081-exec-5] c.g.s.controller.DoctorPortalController  : Going to call doctors service
```

Sample Log of Log Sleuth  in Doctor Service
```
2020-05-02 17:45:49.375  INFO [doctor-service,2bab3210f7517ebe,e73a1aa96386a0e1,false] 21192 --- [nio-9081-exec-2] c.g.s.controller.DoctorController        : got hit on /allDoctors/Apollo
```
Sample Log in Notification Service 
```
2020-05-02 17:45:49.391  INFO [notification-service,2bab3210f7517ebe,3889c876550da22d,false] 15564 --- [nio-5081-exec-6] c.g.s.controller.NotificationController  : notified user for enquiry of - doctors
```
- 2bab3210f7517ebe - Trace ID (Same for 3 service as its a part of a common request)
- e73a1aa96386a0e1 - Span ID
- false - represents whether logs are exported. It will be true when Zipkin server is on
